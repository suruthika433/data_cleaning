This project involves cleaning and preprocessing the Netflix dataset using Microsoft Excel. The goal is to prepare the data for analysis by removing inconsistencies, duplicates, and formatting issues.
Removed Duplicate Rows:

Used Data → Remove Duplicates to eliminate repeated records.

Standardized Text Values:

Made sure fields like Country and Category had consistent spelling/capitalization using Find and Replace and manual checks.

Renamed Column Headers:

Converted all column headers to UPPERCASE for uniformity.

Inserted New Columns:

Added helper columns using Insert → Column for derived data where needed.

Used Filters to locate blanks and handled them appropriately (e.g., filling, removing, or marking as "Unknown").
